For our final project, we're going to take a deep dive into the world of HBO movies and TV shows.
HBO has been providing quality content to its viewers for decades, but have you ever been stuck on what to watch? By analyzing ratings, popularity, and your favorite actors/actresses, lets take a look at what HBO can offer to its loyal fans.

# What we will be looking into?

* Movies and shows on HBO

* What does the distribution of Genres look like for both movies and shows?

* Correlations between age_restriction and genre?

* Actors and Directors involved with HBO

* Actors and Directors associated with highest-rated titles

* Distribution of Number of Movies and Shows by Release Year

* Top 10 most popular Movies and Shows

* Correlation between Run-time of Movies and its Popularity?

* Correlation between Genre and Popularity?

* Correlation between the number of movies and shows produced and what country they come from?

# About Our Data

The dataset we have chosen to work with is sourced from Kaggle and is the property of Diego Enrique. Here is the link to access it: 
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgoenrique/hbo-max-movies-and-tv-shows>

Additionally, we would like to provide the link for rmdformats  library used for the 'readthedown' output theme used in our project, which was created by Julien Barnier. Here's the link to the theme:
<https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2019-12-15/web/packages/rmdformats/vignettes/introduction.html>

## Our data consists of 2 csv's:

## Titles data:

15 variables, 3030 observations

id: The title ID

title: The name of the title

show_type: Tv show or Movie

description: A description of movie or tv show

release_year: Year show/movie was released

age_certification: The age rating of movie or show

runtime: The length of the episode of show or movie in minutes

genres: A list of genres

production_countries: Countries that produced the show/movie

seasons: Number of seasons IF it is a show

imdb_id: The title ID on IMDB

imdb_score: Score on IMDB

imdb_votes: Votes on IMDB

tmdb_popularity: Popularity on TMDB

tmdb_score: Score on TMDB


## Credits data:

5 variables, 64879 observations

person_ID: The person ID on JustWatch

id: The title ID on JustWatch

name: The name of actor or director

character_name: The name of character played in movie/show

role: ACTOR or DIRECTOR

# Let us read our datas, shall we?

```{r read , echo = FALSE}

credits = read.csv("credits.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
titles = read.csv("titles.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## stringsAsFactors = FALSE is used to prevent R from automatically converting character vectors to factors when creating a data frame
```

#### We're using the kable and head function to show a part of the data sets we're working on but in an organized manner

## Here's our credits.csv

```{r credits, echo = FALSE}

kable(head(credits),
      align = "c",
      caption = "<b><center>Sample table of credits data",
      format = "html") %>% 
kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

```
Unfortunately, I do not recognize ANY of these people. Let's see if we have any better luck with our Titles Data...

## Here's our titles.csv
```{r titles, echo = FALSE}

titles <- within(titles, rm(description))

kable(head(titles),
      align = "c",
      caption = "<b><center>Sample table of titles data",
      format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)
  
```
Okay! I definitely recognize some of those! I mean, I hope a majority of people recognize The Wizard of Oz or Tom and Jerry...

It looks like both the Titles data and Credits data have a common variable... I wonder...

## What will it look like if we try to combine these data sets?

```{r combined}
both_data <- left_join(titles, credits, by = "id")

kable(head(both_data),
      align = "c",
      caption = "<b><center>Sample table of both data",
      format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

```

Interesting! It looks like the titles are listed as many times as there are actors/directors associated with it. Because of this...

# Let's begin by determining the number or movies and TV shows we are working with

```{r MoviesAndShow, echo = FALSE}
titles %>% 
  count(type) %>%  
  kable(format = "markdown",align = "c", col.names = c("Type", "Count")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

## kable_styling() creates a nicely formatted table

```


Wow! that's a lot more movies than shows!
 But let's see it visually...
 
```{r MoviesAndShowGraph, echo = FALSE}
# Create a data frame with counts of movies and shows
title_counts = data.frame(
  type = c("MOVIE", "SHOW"),
  Count = c(sum(titles$type == "MOVIE"), sum(titles$type == "SHOW"))
)

# Create the bar chart
ggplot(title_counts, aes(x = type, y = Count, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +geom_text(aes(label = Count ))+ ## We have learnt this line of code from Max. this displays the count on each bar
  ggtitle("Number of Movies and Shows") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Count")

```


# What's the distribution of genres for both Shows and Movies in our dataset?

```{r Distribution of Genres, echo=FALSE}

genre_counts <- titles %>%
  mutate(genres = str_remove_all(genres, "'")) %>%                             
  mutate(genres = gsub("\\[", "", genres)) %>% 
  mutate(genres = gsub("\\]", "", genres)) %>% 
  separate_rows(genres, sep = ", ") %>%     
  group_by(genres, type) %>%                
  summarize(Count = n()) %>%                  
  ungroup() %>%                               
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>%  
  filter(genres != "")     ## This will remove any rows where the "genres" column is blank
  

## We did a lot of mutating because the genres in our titles.csv were grouped together and are inside [] 
##  separate_rows splits the 'genres' column that are separated by commas
##  groups the data by genres and type
##  summarize counts the number of titles that belongs to genres and type
##  ungroups() ungroups the grouping that was set up
##  we set our data at descending order because we want it to display the most popular genres for movies and TV shows at the top



# Creating the bar chart and set fill as 'type' so that it's easier to differentiate between shows and movies

ggplot(genre_counts, aes(x = reorder(genres, Count), y = Count, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")  +
  labs(x = "Genre", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Genres") +
  theme_minimal()+coord_flip()   ## We flipped our coordinates so that the genre labels are easily readable  

```

We can further see how many more movies there are in each genre than there are shows. We can also see that the drama and comedy categories have the most amount of movies and shows, while western has the least. 


# Now, let us see if there's a correlation between age_restriction and genres
```{r age_restriction and genres, echo=FALSE}

## Let's look at how many kinds of age certification are we dealing with
  #kable(unique(titles$age_certification))

## We didn't like the output taking up so much space so were creating a variable unique_age_certifications that contains the unique values of age_certification 
## We then use paste() to concatenate unique_age_certifications but with each value separated by comma and space

age_certifications = na.omit(titles$age_certification)  
#this code did not work because missing columns are empty strings and not represented as NA

#lets try using nzchar() 
age_certifications <- titles$age_certification[nzchar(titles$age_certification)]  ## nzchar() removes empty strings

unique_age_certifications = unique(age_certifications)
age_certifications_string = paste(unique_age_certifications, collapse = ", ")
cat("Unique age certifications: ", age_certifications_string, "\n")   ##cat() helps print concatenated string with Unique age certifications: before our age_certifications_string


new_genre_counts = titles %>%
  mutate(genres = str_remove_all(genres, "'")) %>%                             
  mutate(genres = gsub("\\[", "", genres)) %>% 
  mutate(genres = gsub("\\]", "", genres)) %>% 
  separate_rows(genres, sep = ", ") %>%     
  group_by(genres, type, age_certification) %>%                
  summarize(age_genre_count = n()) %>%                  
  ungroup() %>%                               
  arrange(desc(age_genre_count)) %>%  
  filter(genres != ""& nzchar(age_certification))


#new_genre_counts <- new_genre_counts %>% 
#  arrange(desc(age_genre_count)) %>% 
#  filter(genres != "" & nzchar(age_certification))


## Plotting
ggplot(new_genre_counts,aes(x=age_certification , y=age_genre_count, fill = genres)) + geom_col(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Age Certification", y = "Number of Titles", title = "Age Certification and Genres") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
  #guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)) 
  #facet_wrap(~genres, scales = "free_x")   ### BAD IDEA
  

```

Ohhh... Pretty, but that did not work as expected. Let's see if a geom_tile graph does the job:

```{r age_restriction and genres2, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(new_genre_counts, aes(x = age_certification, y = genres, fill = age_genre_count)) +
  geom_tile(color= "white") +
  labs(x = "Age Certification", y = "Genres", title = "Age Certification and Genres") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "slateblue1", high = "mediumorchid3") +
  theme_grey()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title = "Number of Titles", barwidth = 1, barheight = 4))
  

```
Okay, we can see more clearly that there are more R rated Thriller and Drama titles. The only other ratings that have a slightly different color than the rest are PG, PG-13, and TV-MA. 

# Now lets look at our Actor and Director columns in our credits data. 

```{r credits data, echo=FALSE}

kable(credits %>%
  count(role)) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

```

#### Since actors and directors can have multiple projects, lets remove the duplicates

```{r removing duplicates, echo=FALSE}
## Checking how many unique entries in name column
unique_actors =  credits %>%
  filter(role == "ACTOR") %>% 
  select(name) %>%
  summarize(unique_names_of_actors = n_distinct(name))

unique_directors =  credits %>%
  filter(role == "DIRECTOR") %>% 
  select(name) %>%
  summarize(unique_names_of_directors = n_distinct(name))

kable(unique_actors, align = "c",caption = "Unique name for actors") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

kable(unique_directors, align = "c",caption = "Unique name for directors") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

```

## Are any of these actors/directors in multiple projects? If so, who was in the most projects?

```{r most project for A and D , echo=FALSE}
#ACTORS
actors_projects_per_person = credits %>%  
  group_by(person_id, name, role) %>% 
  summarize(num_projects = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%  
  filter(role == "ACTOR")

# most project for actors
actor_most_project = actors_projects_per_person %>%  group_by(person_id, name, role) %>% 
  summarize(total_projects = sum(num_projects)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_projects))



kable(head(actor_most_project,align = "c", caption= "Actors with most projects"))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

#DIRECTORS
directors_projects_per_person = credits %>%  
  group_by(person_id, name, role) %>% 
  summarize(num_projects = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%  
  filter(role == "DIRECTOR")

# most project for directors
directors_most_project = directors_projects_per_person %>%  
  group_by(person_id, name, role) %>% 
  summarize(total_projects = sum(num_projects)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_projects))

kable(head(directors_most_project,align = "c", caption= "Directors with most projects"))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

```

Sadly, I also don't recognize any of these actors. 

### Let's see what Grey DeLisle is involved in as the actor with the most projects...

```{r}
DeLisle_projects = both_data %>%
  filter(name == "Grey DeLisle") %>%
  select(name, title, release_year, type, role, character )

kable(head(DeLisle_projects,align = "c", caption= "Actors with most projects"))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)
```
OH! So they are a Voice Actor? Super interesting...

### What about Charlie Chaplin as the Director with the most projects? 

```{r}
Chaplin_projects = both_data %>%
  filter(name == "Charlie Chaplin") %>%
  select(name, title, release_year, type, role)

kable(head(Chaplin_projects,align = "c", caption= "Actors with most projects"))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)
```
Whoa! So not only was Charlie Chaplin a Director, but also an Actor for these projects too? 

##  Which actors and directors are among the highiest-rated scores based on an average of IMDB and TMDB scores

```{r Actors/Directors highiest-rated titles, echo=FALSE}
both_data <- inner_join(titles, credits, by = "id")

both_data = both_data %>%  mutate(average_score = (imdb_score + tmdb_score)/2)

highiest_rated = both_data %>%  select(person_id,name, role,title, average_score,imdb_score,tmdb_score) %>%  
  group_by(title) %>% slice_sample(n = 1) %>% arrange(desc(average_score)) %>% 
  head(10)

kable( highiest_rated, align = "c",
  caption = "<b><center>Actors/Directors highiest-rated titles",
  format = "html" ) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)


```

# Here is the distribution of shows and movies available in HBO by release year

```{r shows available in HBO by release year, echo = FALSE}

# plot number of titles by year and type
ggplot(titles , aes(x = release_year, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(color ="white", size = .1) +
  labs(x = "Release Year", y = "Number of Titles", title = "Number of Shows and Movies Available by Year") +
  #scale_fill_manual(values = c("SHOW" = "blue", "MOVIE" = "red")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1900, 2020, by = 10), labels = paste0(seq(1900, 2020, by = 10), "s")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))

```

## Here's the summary table of what the graph shows

```{r decade summary, echo =FALSE}
## creating a new column in our titles.csv called decades: this will categorize what release year as per their decades

titles$decade = cut(titles$release_year, 
                    breaks = c(seq(1899, 2019, 10), 2021), 
                    labels = paste0(seq(1900, 2020, 10), "s"))

summary_table = titles %>% 
  group_by(type, decade) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) #%>% pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)


#kable(summary_table)

kable(summary_table %>% pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count),
      align = "c",
      caption = "<b><center>Number of Shows and Movies Available by Year",
      format = "html")%>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)
```

This indicates us that HBO primarily features Movies and Shows from the decade of 2010s

You can see there is a wide range of movies and TV shows, especially what year they were released. 

## I wonder what the  oldest movies and shows are?

```{r oldest movies and shows , echo = FALSE}

## Oldest movie
kable(head(titles %>%
  filter(type == "MOVIE") %>%
  arrange(release_year) %>%
  select(title, release_year, genres) %>% 
    head(1)),
  align = "c",
  caption = "<b><center>Oldest Movie on HBO",
  format = "html" ) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)


## Oldest show
kable(head(titles %>%
  filter(type == "SHOW") %>%
  arrange(release_year) %>%
  select(title, release_year, genres) %>% 
    head(1)),
  align = "c",
  caption = "<b><center>Oldest Show on HBO",
  format = "html" ) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)


## Newest movie
kable(head(titles %>%
  filter(type == "MOVIE") %>%
  arrange(desc(release_year)) %>%
  select(title, release_year, genres) %>% 
    head(1)),

  caption = "<b><center>Newest Movie on HBO",
  format = "html" ) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)


## Newewst show
kable(head(titles %>%
  filter(type == "SHOW") %>%
  arrange(desc(release_year)) %>%
  select(title, release_year, genres) %>% 
    head(1)),
  align = "c",
  caption = "<b><center>Newest Show on HBO",
  format = "html" ) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

```


```{r (not using- Distribution of genres over time), echo=FALSE}

# Now let's see what are the top 10 most popular movies and show from imbd and tmdb

## Here are HBO's top 10 movies and shows according to imdb score
```{r top_10s , echo = FALSE}

## Let's see if we can get a correlation from both imdb and tmdb scores find an average

# Ever wonder if your most favourite genre happens to be the most popular genre on HBO?
## Let's find out 
Here's genre vs popularity graph based on movies and shows


```{r genre_popularity, echo=FALSE}
genre_popularity <- titles %>%
  mutate(genres = str_remove_all(genres, "'")) %>% 
  mutate(genres = gsub("\\[", "", genres)) %>% 
  mutate(genres = gsub("\\]", "", genres)) %>% 
  separate_rows(genres, sep = ", ") %>%
  group_by(genres, type,tmdb_popularity,tmdb_score, imdb_score ) %>%
  summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(tmdb_popularity))



# Create the bar chart
ggplot(genre_popularity, aes(x = reorder(genres, Count), y = tmdb_popularity, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")  +
  labs(x = "Genre", y = "tmdb_popularity", title = "Genres and its popularity") +
  theme_light()+coord_flip()
```

# Last but not least, let us look at the Number of movies and TV shows by country 

Unfortunately, because HBO only got their movies and shows from 99 countries, there are some uncolored countries 
```{r countries, echo=FALSE}
countries = titles %>%
  mutate(production_countries = str_remove_all(production_countries, "'")) %>% 
  mutate(production_countries = gsub("\\[", "", production_countries)) %>% 
  mutate(production_countries = gsub("\\]", "", production_countries)) %>% 
  separate_rows(production_countries, sep = ", ") %>%
  group_by(production_countries, type) %>%
  summarize(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

## Removing rows that has country unknown
countries = filter(countries, !is.na(production_countries) & production_countries != "") 

## Creating a new column that represents the full country name of production countries
countries$full_country_name <- countrycode(sourcevar = countries$production_countries, origin = "iso2c", destination= "country.name")



# Renaming "United States" to "USA" to match with data in world_map
countries <- countries %>% 
  mutate(full_country_name = if_else(full_country_name == "United States", "USA", full_country_name))

## We're going to try to show this data using a world map
world_map = map_data("world")
  

## Let's join our world map and our countries data
world_map_data= full_join(world_map, countries, by = c("region" = "full_country_name"))

## Plotting
 
  ggplot(world_map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = total)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(limits = c(0, 1824), low = "orchid", mid = "darkorchid", high = "darkmagenta", midpoint = 900) +
  labs(title = "Number of movies and TV shows by country", fill = "Count") + 
  theme_bw()
 
```

## Here’s the summary table of what the map shows

```{r countries table, echo=FALSE}
kable(countries %>% pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = total),
      align = "c",
      caption = "<b><center>Number of movies and TV shows by country",
      format = "html")%>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)
```



# Final Summary

Hopefully, after the end of this, we may have created some tools to help you when you can't figure out what to watch. If you are looking for more variety, you would probably want to stick with movies as you have all types of options to choose from. Same with if you are wanting something newer. Based on our movies and shows by distribution graph, you will definitely have more options from the 1990's - 2000's. If you want to stick with a specific genre, our genre and popularity graph will help you with that, for example it shows that the drama genre is the most popular.
